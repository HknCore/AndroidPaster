The Andriod-Emulator has issues with copy paste, thats why I decided
to create my own piece of software to handle this lacking feature.
AndroidPaster uses adb and autohotkey to listen for keystrokes and 
to execute a command in the android command prompt. The command
just pastes your current clippboard. Enjoy!


NEEDED FILES WILL BE GENERATED IN THE CURRENT FOLDER.
PLEASE CREATE A SHORTCUT IF YOU WANT TO USE IT OUTSIDE THIS FOLDER.
